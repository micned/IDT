IDT: Individualized Discounting Task
====================================

The *IDT* is an adaptive individualized delay discounting task for functional magnetic resonance imaging as described in `Koffarnus et al. 2017 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917306717>`_. The corresponding statistical maps can be downloaded from `neurovault.org <https://neurovault.org/collections/GWAYZDJA/>`_.

Since the *IDT* is individualized, the out-of-scanner version needs to be performed first.
